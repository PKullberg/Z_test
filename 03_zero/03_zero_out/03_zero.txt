---------------------======********** RANKING STARTS HERE ***********======-----------------------
Initially removed cells count = 0
Note: No initial removal was used.

Biodiversity features performance levels check. Proportions remaining:
---------
Feature 1:    1
---------
Minimum proportion remaining:    1, average:    1, weighted average:    1, maximum:    1


The following lines provide information on how the ranking is done by iterative removal of cells, with 6 columns per line:
Cells removed, proportion of landscape remaining, cost of remaining landscape, edge list length, smallest remaining proportion in all biodiversity features (e.g. species), time elapsed (s)
