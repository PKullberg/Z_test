---------------------======********** RANKING STARTS HERE ***********======-----------------------
Initially removed cells count = 0
Note: No initial removal was used.

Biodiversity features performance levels check. Proportions remaining:
---------
Feature 1: 0.9999978
---------
Minimum proportion remaining: 0.9999977, average: 0.9999977, weighted average: 0.9999977, maximum: 0.9999977


The following lines provide information on how the ranking is done by iterative removal of cells, with 6 columns per line:
Cells removed, proportion of landscape remaining, cost of remaining landscape, edge list length, smallest remaining proportion in all biodiversity features (e.g. species), time elapsed (s)
